# Pulumi X Community

The repository is made to create a place where people can talk about Pulumi X. The intentions of this
organization and community is to create Pulumi-based libraries by the community. The idea was initiated
by a [Reddit comment][reddit-comment].

## Want to join the discussion?

Create an issue, introduce what you want to bring to the Pulumi X community â€“ and off you go!

## Motivation

There are many libraries or collection of components for Pulumi out there. Most of them are made by needs
of the individual companies and developers. Pulumi X aims to make a community where these libraries can
be created, where opioniated configurations for Pulumi resources can be stored and discussed.
